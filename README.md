# Build cache
This repository contains archives of precompiled code for the ESP-IDF archetype.

The initial compile of an ESP-IDF project can take a very long time.
By allowing the download of precompiled, the first time compile can be sped up immensly.

One should not download this manually, but rather let the build tools take care of it.
